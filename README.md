# hunt-the-wumpus
This is a project I completed for my data structures and algorithms class to implement my own graph class and make a game. 

To compile, use the command "javac *.java" while inside a directory with all the files. To run call "java HuntTheWumpus" 

For this project, I was given the instructions for hunt the wumpus and expected to implement the game with little further guidence. I implemented a graph class to hold the spaces over which the player can move and which the wumpus will inhabit. I was also given a basis for the LandscapeDisplay.java file but also expanded upon this class myself to improve my GUI and make it work properly for the game. 

Instructions:

1. The player appears as the box with the green circle. 
2. The small black boxes within the squares indicate directions the player can move. 
3. The use "w" to move up, "s" for down, "a" for left and "d" for right. 
4. When the player is within two spaces of the wumpus, the square will appear red. 
5. To win, the player must hit the wumpus with the the arrow. Press the space bar to arm and disarm the player. When armed, use the movement buttons to shoot the arrow to an adjacent space. (The player appears red, rather than green while armed.)
6. If the arrow misses the wumpus, the wumpus will hear and eat the player. If the player sucessfully hits the wumpus with the arrow, the player wins. 
7. Enjoy the game!
